# Optional:  Set up a pull-up or pull-down resistor if needed.
# This helps to ensure a stable reading if your input signal is not actively driven.
#
# To enable pull-up resistor:
# data_pin = Pin(2, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
#
# To enable pull-down resistor:
# data_pin = Pin(2, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)
#
# If your sensor/device actively drives the pin HIGH or LOW, you don't need a pull resistor.
